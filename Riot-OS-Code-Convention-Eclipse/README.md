# Riot OS code convention
This is a configuration file for eclipse to make C code follow as much as possible Linux Codystyle with some minor changes to fit the Riot-OS code convention.

The initial file was taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/txomon/8397487).

This file is distributed as is, i guarantee neither for completeness nor correctness. 

Any comment are welcome...
